# Cellular Sheaves for Coordinating LLM Agents in Synthetic Data Generation

## Introduction  
Large Language Models (LLMs) can be organized into **multi-agent systems** to collaboratively generate synthetic data for training and evaluation. Recent works have shown that multi-LLM workflows (e.g. pairing a generator with a reviewer or multiple role-playing agents) can produce higher-quality and more diverse data than a single model acting alone ([[2408.08688] The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08688#:~:text=Judge%2C%20LLMs,PO%20datasets%20using%20the%20above)) ([Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#:~:text=Post,Notably%2C%20on%20AlpacaEval%202%20and)). However, coordinating a team of LLM agents poses significant challenges. Agents may have **heterogeneous internal reasoning** (different model architectures, domains, or prompt constraints) and operate with varying knowledge (some only local context, others global knowledge base access). They must satisfy **global goals** such as: 

- **Consistency:** aligning on shared facts or scenarios (a form of consensus).  
- **Diversity:** ensuring outputs are varied and covering different modes, with minimal redundancy (analogous to a *dissensus* objective).  
- **Global coherence:** reconciling partial or overlapping “beliefs” or content so that the final dataset or knowledge base is mutually coherent and complete.  

**Cellular sheaf theory** – a tool from algebraic topology – offers a principled **local-to-global modeling framework** to address these challenges. In this overview, we explore how the **Cellular Sheaves for Distributed Multi-Agent Coordination** framework ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=different%20agents,their%20own%20control%20objectives%20while)) can be applied to LLM-based agents generating synthetic data. We discuss how **cellular sheaves, nonlinear sheaf Laplacians, and ADMM-based distributed optimization** can coordinate LLM agents by encoding inter-agent constraints (consensus, diversity, etc.) and guiding local agent behavior toward global objectives. We also draw analogies to existing multi-agent LLM systems ([[2408.08688] The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08688#:~:text=Judge%2C%20LLMs,PO%20datasets%20using%20the%20above)) ([Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#:~:text=In%20this%20work%2C%20we%20introduce,world%20human)) and highlight sheaf-theoretic measures (like cohomology) that quantify global consistency. Throughout, concrete examples and pseudocode illustrate the concepts.

## Cellular Sheaves and Multi-Agent Coordination Overview  
**Cellular sheaves** generalize graphs by assigning data “stalks” (e.g. vector spaces or sets) to every node and edge of a graph, along with restriction maps that specify how node data must agree on each connecting edge ([[2202.04579] Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04579#:~:text=,a%20hierarchy%20of%20increasingly%20general)). In essence, a sheaf encodes what it means for **local information to be consistent globally**. A **section** of a sheaf is a choice of data at every node that, on each edge, satisfies the restriction (i.e. the adjacent nodes’ data agree or meet a constraint on that edge). A **global section** is a section satisfying *all* edge constraints – it represents a fully consistent global state assembled from the locals ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=It%20follows%20immediately%20that%20because,the%20dimensions%20of%20the%20stalks)). If agents are nodes and edges represent pairwise interactions, a global section corresponds to all agents’ outputs being in agreement with each other where required.

This sheaf-based perspective is well-suited to **multi-agent coordination problems**. Indeed, Hanks *et al.* (2025) unify heterogeneous multi-agent control tasks (like consensus, formation, flocking) as *nonlinear homological programs* defined on cellular sheaves ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=of%20systems%20involved%20or%20the,demonstrate%20the%20applicability%20of%20this)) ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=systems%20has%20lead%20to%20a,17%5D.%20The%20proposed)). Each agent (node) has a **local objective** and each interaction (edge) has a **potential function** encoding the desired relationship between agents’ states ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=In%20a%20system%20of%20agents,43)) ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=systems%20has%20lead%20to%20a,17%5D.%20The%20proposed)). The framework’s generality allows **heterogeneity** in agent dynamics and goals – different nodes can have different internal models and edges can enforce different types of constraints ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=flocking,due%20to%20its%20attractive%20convergence)). Classic coordination goals appear as special cases: e.g. a quadratic edge potential that penalizes differences yields **consensus**, whereas a potential that rewards difference could encode a form of **dissensus** for diversity ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=systems%20has%20lead%20to%20a,17%5D.%20The%20proposed)).

A key construct is the **nonlinear sheaf Laplacian**, which generalizes the graph Laplacian to sheaves with possibly nonlinear edge constraints ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=general%20unified%20framework%20for%20heterogeneous,demonstrate%20the%20applicability%20of%20this)) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=A%20decentralized%20approach%20to%20computing,a%20choice%20of%20edge%20potentials)). Intuitively, the sheaf Laplacian of a section measures the “mismatch” along each edge – much like a graph Laplacian measures differences between neighbors. The Laplacian is zero if and only if the section is a global section satisfying all constraints ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=condition%20as%20a%20cellular%20sheaf,steps%20starting%20from)). By designing appropriate edge potentials, one can induce a **dynamical system** where agents’ states evolve according to (gradient-descent-like) Laplacian flows that converge to a consistent solution ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=A%20decentralized%20approach%20to%20computing,a%20choice%20of%20edge%20potentials)). In linear cases (e.g. simple consensus), this reduces to the usual diffusion/heat equation on a graph driving agreement ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=A%20decentralized%20approach%20to%20computing,a%20choice%20of%20edge%20potentials)). In general cases, **nonlinear sheaf Laplacian dynamics** capture more complex couplings (though care is needed, as nonconvex potentials can introduce multiple equilibria or divergence ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=While%20linear%20sheaf%20Laplacians%20converge,their%20the%20projection%20onto))). The beauty of this framework is that it remains **distributed**: the Laplacian at each node is computed from only its local state and those of its neighbors ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=The%20nonlinear%20sheaf%20Laplacian%20acts,on%20local%20sections%20as)), reflecting purely local communication.

**Sheaf cohomology** provides a theoretical handle on global consistency. The space of all possible local assignments (0-cochains) and the constraint operator (coboundary $\delta$) lead to algebraic invariants: $H^0$ (0th cohomology) is the space of global sections and $H^1$ (1st cohomology) captures the “obstructions” or inconsistency cycles ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=flow%20to%20a%20global%20section,cellular%20sheaf%20is%20given%20by)). If $H^1$ is nonzero, it means there are some assignments that cannot be globally unified – a situation analogous to conflicting beliefs among agents. In practical terms, a nonzero cohomology class might flag an irreconcilable disagreement or inconsistency in the multi-agent system. The goal of coordination is often to drive the system to $H^1=0$ (no outstanding conflicts) by adjusting local states. The size of $H^1$ or the norm of the sheaf Laplacian can serve as a **measure of how far the system is from global consistency** – useful for diagnosing if the LLM agents have residual disagreements or redundant outputs that haven’t been resolved.

## Mapping LLM Agents to a Sheaf-Theoretic Model  
Consider a network of LLM agents cooperating to generate a synthetic dataset (e.g. a set of question-answer pairs, or a jointly authored document). We can construct a **cellular sheaf** over the agent communication graph to model this setup:

- **Agents as Nodes:** Each agent $i$ (node in the graph) has an associated *data space* $F(i)$ representing the space of outputs or knowledge it can produce. For example, $F(i)$ could be the set of all possible text outputs of Agent $i$ (or a vector space embedding thereof). A *local section* $x_i \in F(i)$ would be a specific synthetic data output or a set of content that agent produces. Each agent also has an internal objective function $\varphi_i(x_i)$ encoding its preferences – e.g. how well the output matches its knowledge base, or an inverse measure of perplexity, or other quality metrics (factuality, creativity, etc.).

- **Interactions as Edges:** An edge $(i,j)$ between agents carries a *constraint space* $F(i,j)$ and a restriction map from each incident node’s space: $r_{i\to (i,j)}: F(i)\to F(i,j)$ and $r_{j\to (i,j)}: F(j)\to F(i,j)$. These maps extract the parts of each agent’s output that should **agree** or relate. For instance, if agents $i$ and $j$ are both writing different sections of a synthetic story, $F(i,j)$ might represent the overlapping storyline or character details that must be consistent between their chapters. If two agents generate Q&A pairs on overlapping topics, $F(i,j)$ could be the subset of questions or facts that appear in both of their outputs. The requirement that a section is global means for every edge $(i,j)$, we require $r_{i\to (i,j)}(x_i) = r_{j\to (i,j)}(x_j)$ – the two agents’ outputs coincide on the overlapping portion. This is the **consistency constraint** analogous to consensus (or more generally, some relation $h(x_i, x_j) = 0$ defined by the edge potential, as discussed below).

- **Knowledge Base as a Sheaf:** We can also model shared knowledge as part of the sheaf. For example, if there is a global knowledge base or a common memory accessible by all, that could be represented as an additional node (or a topological “covering” that all agent nodes connect to). However, the prompt suggests agents may operate with local or global knowledge: this can be represented by whether the sheaf has a “constant” section for knowledge (all agents share certain information) or whether each agent’s knowledge is separate. In a sheaf, a **constant sheaf** on the graph would give each agent a copy of some global context and impose equality on edges (so they all share that context) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=In%20a%20system%20of%20agents,43)). Alternatively, a non-constant sheaf allows each agent to have its own knowledge and only partial overlaps with others via the $F(i,j)$ restrictions.

- **Heterogeneous Agent Models:** Sheaf modeling naturally handles heterogeneous agents. Each node’s space $F(i)$ and objective $\varphi_i$ can be tailored to the agent. For example, one LLM agent might be specialized in medical text (so its output space and internal constraints differ from an agent specialized in legal text). This is analogous to different robot dynamics in the original framework – but here it could mean different language styles or reasoning constraints. The sheaf imposes that despite these differences, certain **interface variables** on edges must align. As noted by Hanks *et al.*, the framework “enables heterogeneity not only in the systems being controlled, but also in the communication patterns and coordination goals” ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=flocking,due%20to%20its%20attractive%20convergence)). In an LLM context, this means we can mix agents of different types and still formally define how they coordinate through shared variables (e.g. two different models must output the same answer to an overlapping question, or ensure one’s question is answered by another’s answer correctly).

In summary, a cellular sheaf for LLM agents provides a **modular blueprint**: each agent is a self-contained module with its own state/output and objective, and each inter-agent relationship is a constraint module that glues the agents’ outputs together. New agents or new constraints can be added by simply adding nodes or edges (reflecting the **compositionality** of the approach). The global sections of this sheaf correspond to **globally consistent sets of synthetic data** – i.e. each agent’s output is coherent with others on overlaps, yielding an integrated dataset with no contradictions in shared content.

## Encoding Inter-Agent Constraints with Edge Potentials  
To enforce properties like consensus, diversity, and minimal redundancy among the LLM agents, we attach appropriate **edge potential functions** to each sheaf restriction (each edge of the graph). In the **nonlinear homological program** formulation ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=In%20a%20system%20of%20agents,43)), every edge $(i,j)$ has a potential $\psi_{ij}(x_i, x_j)$ that penalizes undesired configurations or encourages desired ones. Let’s discuss how different objectives can be encoded:

- **Consensus / Consistency Constraints:** To ensure two agents agree on overlapping content, we introduce a potential that penalizes differences between their restricted outputs. For example, if $z_{ij} = r_{i\to (i,j)}(x_i)$ and $z_{ji} = r_{j\to (i,j)}(x_j)$ are the two agents’ projections onto the shared portion, a **consensus potential** could be $\psi_{ij}(x_i, x_j) = \frac{\rho}{2}\|\,z_{ij} - z_{ji}\|^2$ (a quadratic well) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=)). This functions like a *soft constraint* urging $z_{ij} = z_{ji}$. In the limit as $\rho \to \infty$, it becomes a hard constraint $z_{ij}=z_{ji}$. This is analogous to standard consensus protocols (the sheaf Laplacian with this quadratic potential yields the usual graph Laplacian effect ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=))). In an LLM context, $z_{ij}$ might represent, say, the answer to a certain question that both agent $i$ and $j$ attempt to produce – the potential drives them to produce the **same answer** (enforcing factual consistency).

- **Divergence / Diversity Constraints:** Interestingly, the same framework can handle the opposite objective: encouraging agents to *diverge* or cover different outputs (to minimize redundancy). By designing potentials with multiple minima or repulsive characteristics, we can push agents to avoid identical outputs. For example, a simple approach is to use a **negative consensus** or repulsion term: $\psi_{ij}^{\text{div}}(x_i, x_j) = \frac{\mu}{2}\big(\max(0, M - \|z_{ij}-z_{ji}\|)\big)^2$, which penalizes *small* differences below some margin $M$. Here, if the overlapping content $z_{ij}, z_{ji}$ from two agents is too similar (distance below $M$), the potential cost rises – encouraging those agents to produce sufficiently different content. This could be applied to ensure two agents do not generate the **same questions or sentences**, for instance. Another formulation is to treat diversity as each agent covering distinct *modes*: we can introduce an overlap measure (like an inner product or content similarity) and penalize it to push it toward zero. In effect, this is a **dissensus** objective (ensuring agents *disagree* or at least differ) ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=systems%20has%20lead%20to%20a,17%5D.%20The%20proposed)). Some prior multi-agent frameworks explicitly consider “dissensus” to spread out over state space ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=systems%20has%20lead%20to%20a,17%5D.%20The%20proposed)). In LLM synthetic data generation, this is key to avoid duplicate data points and to improve coverage of the data space.

- **Partial Agreement on Interfaces:** Not all constraints are all-or-nothing; some might require partial structure sharing. For example, if agent $i$ is generating a question and agent $j$ is generating an answer, the question text and answer text should complement each other rather than be identical. In sheaf terms, we might have a *dependency* where the content of $x_i$ (question) must match the topic of $x_j$ (answer) but not be identical strings. We could formalize this by having the restriction map pick out the question topic or keywords, and the edge potential enforce that those keywords appear appropriately in the answer. This could be a complex constraint but still local to edge $(i,j)$. In general, **nonlinear edge potentials** $\psi_{ij}(x_i,x_j)$ can encode arbitrary relationships (not just differences) as long as they are computable from the local data of the two agents. Examples include logical constraints (“if agent $i$ output contains concept A, agent $j$’s output must contain concept B”), formatting constraints (two parts of a document should have the same style or not contradict each other), or coverage constraints (agents’ outputs should collectively cover a set of required elements – which can be enforced by pairwise penalties if any required element is missing).

All these potentials enter the overall objective of the system. If we denote the set of all agents as $V$ and edges as $E$, the **global objective** for the multi-agent sheaf can be written as a sum of local objectives and edge potentials: 

$$
\min_{\{x_i\}}\;\; \sum_{i\in V} \varphi_i(x_i)\;+\;\sum_{(i,j)\in E} \psi_{ij}(x_i, x_j),
$$

subject to $x_i \in F(i)$ for all $i$ (and possibly hard constraints $r_{i\to (i,j)}(x_i) = r_{j\to (i,j)}(x_j)$ if some consistency is required outright). This formulation is exactly the **nonlinear homological program** on a sheaf ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=In%20a%20system%20of%20agents,43)): each node’s decision $x_i$ is coupled with its neighbors’ decisions through the edge terms. Notably, if all $\psi_{ij}$ are convex and each $\varphi_i$ is convex, the problem is a convex optimization  ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=The%20following%20theorem%20describes%20when,us%20to%20solve%20them%20efficiently)), but even if not, one can often find good local optima by iterative methods.

**Sheaf Cohomology for Constraint Satisfaction:** As the agents work to satisfy these constraints, it’s useful to measure progress. In sheaf-theoretic terms, one monitors the **coboundary** $\delta(x)$ of the current assignment $x = \{x_i\}$. The coboundary maps the collection of node data to an assignment on edges representing the constraint residuals. If $\delta(x) = 0$, we have a global section (perfect satisfaction). If not, $\delta(x)$ is an *inconsistency 1-cochain*. The magnitude of $\delta(x)$ (e.g. sum of squared norm of all $z_{ij}-z_{ji}$) could serve as a **global loss** for agreement. Moreover, if the inconsistencies form cycles (for example, agent A and B disagree on something, B and C disagree, but A and C might still agree pairwise – leading to a loop of contradictions), this would show up as a nontrivial element in $H^1$. A nonzero $H^1$ indicates that no matter how the agents adjust, a certain combination of constraints can’t all be satisfied simultaneously – an important insight for diagnosing conflicting goals or knowledge among LLMs. In such a case, designers might need to relax some constraints or introduce an additional agent to resolve the conflict.

## Distributed Optimization via Nonlinear Sheaf Laplacian and ADMM  
To practically find a consistent global output (a global section) that also optimizes the objectives, we need an **algorithm** that the LLM agents can execute in a decentralized manner. The **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)** is a natural choice to solve the above constrained optimization and is in fact the method used by the cellular sheaf coordination framework ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=different%20agents,their%20own%20control%20objectives%20while)). ADMM is well-suited because it breaks a global problem into local subproblems with iterative coordination, and it converges under mild conditions ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=cellular%20sheaves,and%20communication%20with%20neighboring%20agents)).

**ADMM on a Sheaf:** The idea of ADMM in this context is to introduce auxiliary variables for the edge agreements and iteratively enforce them. Concretely, for each edge $(i,j)$, we introduce a variable $z_{ij}$ that represents the “agreed” value on that edge’s constraint space $F(i,j)$. We constrain that $r_{i\to (i,j)}(x_i) = z_{ij}$ and $r_{j\to (i,j)}(x_j) = z_{ij}$ for all edges – so $z_{ij}$ serves as the consensus value that $i$ and $j$ both should match. Initially, these $z_{ij}$ might just be set to one of the agents’ projections or an average. ADMM then iteratively performs three steps: **(1) Node update**, **(2) Edge update**, **(3) Dual update** (updating Lagrange multipliers for constraints). At a high level, one iteration looks like:

1. **Local Agent Update (Node primal update):** Each agent $i$ receives the current edge targets $z_{ij}$ (and/or Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_{ij}$) from its neighbors. It then **solves a local optimization**: 
   $$x_i^{(k+1)} := \arg\min_{x_i \in F(i)} \Big[\varphi_i(x_i) + \sum_{j:\,(i,j)\in E} \frac{\rho}{2}\|r_{i\to (i,j)}(x_i) - z_{ij}^{(k)} + \lambda_{ij}^{(k)}\|^2\Big].$$ 
   This means agent $i$ tries to optimize its own objective plus a penalty term for each neighbor that keeps $x_i$’s restricted output close to the current agreed value $z_{ij}^{(k)}$ (adjusted by the dual variable $\lambda_{ij}^{(k)}$). The scalar $\rho$ is a step-size or penalty weight (same $\rho$ as in the earlier quadratic example). This step is done **in parallel by all agents**, since each only needs its local data and neighbor messages. For an LLM, this could mean the agent uses its language model to find an output that best balances its own quality metric and how well it aligns with neighbor-proposed overlaps. (In practice one might approximate this via gradient steps on a differentiable surrogate of the LLM or by sampling candidate outputs and scoring them.)

2. **Edge Consensus Update (Edge primal update):** Now, for each edge $(i,j)$, we update the consensus value $z_{ij}$. A standard ADMM approach is to take the average of the two agents’ projections (if the potential is quadratic) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=)). More generally, we solve:
   $$z_{ij}^{(k+1)} := \arg\min_{z \in F(i,j)}\; \psi_{ij}(z,z) + \frac{\rho}{2}\|r_{i\to (i,j)}(x_i^{(k+1)}) - z + \lambda_{ij}^{(k)}\|^2 + \frac{\rho}{2}\|r_{j\to (i,j)}(x_j^{(k+1)}) - z + \lambda_{ji}^{(k)}\|^2.$$ 
   In words, the edge tries to find a value $z$ that is “close” to both agents’ newly updated local projections, while also possibly optimizing the edge’s own potential $\psi_{ij}$. If $\psi_{ij}$ is just a simple penalty on difference, the solution is effectively $z = \frac{1}{2}\big(r_{i\to e}(x_i^{(k+1)}) + r_{j\to e}(x_j^{(k+1)})\big)$ (the average of the two outputs) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=)). If $\psi_{ij}$ encodes something more complex (like requiring $z$ to not equal those values exactly for diversity), this update might involve a different computation (e.g. find a $z$ that is between the two in some dual space, or even skip if we use soft penalties only). This step is done **in parallel for all edges** (each edge only needs the two adjacent nodes’ info). It yields updated “agreement targets” $z_{ij}^{(k+1)}$.

3. **Dual Variable Update:** For each edge $(i,j)$, update the Lagrange multipliers (which represent the running estimate of constraint violations) as:
   $$\lambda_{ij}^{(k+1)} := \lambda_{ij}^{(k)} + r_{i\to (i,j)}(x_i^{(k+1)}) - z_{ij}^{(k+1)},$$ 
   and similarly $\lambda_{ji}^{(k+1)}$ (in many cases one can use $\lambda_{ij} = -\lambda_{ji}$ for a single multiplier per edge when the constraint is equality). This update nudges the dual variable up or down depending on the residual after the update, and will be used in the next node update to bias the agent’s optimization (if the agent hasn’t met the consensus, the dual term will penalize it more strongly next time, or vice versa).

The agents then iterate these steps, exchanging updated $z$ and $\lambda$ values with their neighbors. **Convergence** is reached when the changes become negligible – at that point, each agent’s output is (approximately) consistent with its neighbors and optimal for its local objective given that consistency. This yields a set of $x_i$ that solve the overall program. As the authors note, this ADMM algorithm “allows agents to minimize their own control objectives while driving the global system towards the coordination goal, all while utilizing only local computations and communication with neighboring agents” ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=cellular%20sheaves,and%20communication%20with%20neighboring%20agents)). In other words, each LLM agent is largely self-directed (optimizing its content for quality) but the ADMM coupling via shared constraints ensures a **global coordination** emerges.

**Sheaf Laplacian Perspective:** The ADMM procedure can be interpreted in terms of the **nonlinear sheaf Laplacian** introduced earlier. The condition for an optimal consistent solution is that the **Laplacian vanishes** (no net “force” on any node to change its state) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=condition%20as%20a%20cellular%20sheaf,steps%20starting%20from)). In practice, the ADMM updates seek a zero of the constrained optimality conditions. If the edge potentials are convex and symmetric, setting the gradient of each agent’s augmented Lagrangian to zero yields something akin to a Laplacian equation. For instance, in a pure consensus scenario, the node update condition $\nabla \varphi_i(x_i) + \sum_{j\in \text{nbr}(i)} \rho\,(x_i - x_j) = 0$ is essentially saying “my gradient plus Laplacian term is zero” – a balance between local optimum and consensus forces. The **nonlinear sheaf Laplacian** $L_F(x)$ for a section $x$ is defined such that its $i$th component is $\sum_{j} \nabla_{z_{ij}}\psi_{ij}(x_i,x_j)$ (the sum of gradients of edge potentials with respect to $i$’s data) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=Suppose%20is%20a%20cellular%20sheaf,as%20the%20gradient%20of)). Setting $L_F(x)=0$ gives the critical point equations for the homological program. In this sense, ADMM is finding a root of the nonlinear sheaf Laplacian by a method of multipliers. Importantly, because the Laplacian can be computed **locally** (each agent uses only neighbor information) ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=The%20nonlinear%20sheaf%20Laplacian%20acts,on%20local%20sections%20as)), the iteration is scalable.

To make this concrete, let’s consider a **simple pseudocode example** for coordinating two LLM agents ($A$ and $B$) with one shared constraint and one diversity constraint:

```python
# Pseudocode for coordinating 2 LLM agents A and B using ADMM
# Assume A and B each produce an output string or embedding x_A, x_B.
# They share a common portion (e.g. overlapping content) and should avoid full redundancy.

initialize x_A, x_B randomly or from independent local optima
initialize z_AB = (r_A(x_A) + r_B(x_B)) / 2   # initial consensus on overlap
initialize lambda_AB = 0
for k in range(max_iters):
    # Agent A local update
    x_A := argmin_{x} [ φ_A(x) 
                        + (ρ/2)*||r_A(x) - z_AB + lambda_AB||^2 
                        + (μ/2)*sim(x, x_B)^2 ]    # example: penalize similarity with B's output for diversity
    
    # Agent B local update
    x_B := argmin_{x} [ φ_B(x) 
                        + (ρ/2)*||r_B(x) - z_AB + (-lambda_AB)||^2 
                        + (μ/2)*sim(x, x_A)^2 ]    # penalize similarity with A
    
    # Edge (A,B) consensus update for overlap 
    z_AB := 0.5 * ( r_A(x_A) + r_B(x_B) )   # new proposed shared content (for strict consensus)
    
    # Dual update (for overlap constraint)
    lambda_AB := lambda_AB + ( r_A(x_A) - z_AB )
    
    # (Optional stopping check: if ||r_A(x_A)-z_AB|| and ||r_B(x_B)-z_AB|| are very small and 
    # diversity objectives satisfied, break loop)
end for
```

In this pseudocode, $\phi_A$ and $\phi_B$ are the local objectives (which could be something like negative log-likelihood of the output under each agent’s model plus any individual preferences). The term `sim(x, x_B)` is a placeholder for a similarity measure between A’s and B’s outputs (to be minimized for diversity – e.g. it could be content overlap or embedding cosine similarity). We include that in the local update as a soft penalty with weight $\mu$. The overlap restriction maps $r_A, r_B$ pick out whatever part of the content should be identical (here enforced via $z_{AB}$). After each iteration, A and B have updated their outputs considering both the consensus requirement and the push for diversity. The edge then reconciles the overlapping portion by averaging (for consensus) and the dual $\lambda_{AB}$ accumulates any residual discrepancy (this effectively will penalize A and B in the next round if they keep deviating on the overlap). Over iterations, A and B will converge to outputs that share the required content (e.g. same underlying fact or consistent story connection) while being otherwise different to maximize diversity.

This simple two-agent example can be scaled up to many agents and complex constraints, as the ADMM loop parallelizes for all nodes and edges. Importantly, **ADMM guarantees convergence** to the optimal solution under convexity assumptions ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=The%20following%20theorem%20describes%20when,us%20to%20solve%20them%20efficiently)), and in practice often finds good feasible points even for nonconvex cases, especially if properly initialized.

## Local-to-Global Structure and Modularity Benefits  
Sheaf-based coordination naturally yields a **modular and hierarchical** system design for multi-agent LLMs. Each agent only concerns itself with local computations and immediate neighbor interactions, yet this is sufficient to achieve a global emergent behavior. Some key benefits of this local-to-global structuring include:

- **Interpretable Constraint Decomposition:** Designers can specify desired global properties (e.g. “agents should agree on facts X, Y, Z”, “each agent should cover different subtopics”) and **compile them into local constraints** on pairs or small groups of agents. The sheaf formalism ensures that if each local constraint is satisfied, the global property is satisfied. This compositionality means we can build complex workflows out of simpler interactions. For example, we might first form small clusters of agents that reach consensus within each cluster while ensuring clusters differ from each other (a hierarchical sheaf: consensus edges inside clusters, diversity edges between cluster representatives). Then a higher-level edge might reconcile cluster outputs if needed. Such **hierarchical coordination** can be seen as a multi-level sheaf, or a sheaf on a larger graph that has “super-nodes” representing clusters. The underlying mathematics remains consistent – a global section now corresponds to consistency at all levels.

- **Plug-and-Play Agents and Goals:** Because each agent’s objective and each edge’s potential are modular, we can add or remove agents or constraints without redesigning the entire solution method. For instance, if we want to introduce a new LLM agent that contributes a different perspective (say an adversarial question generator to increase coverage of edge cases), we add a node and connect it with edges to relevant existing agents (like an edge enforcing that the adversarial questions are answered by the main answer generator agent, plus edges to ensure those questions are novel). The ADMM solver and sheaf Laplacian dynamics **automatically incorporate** the new terms, and the system will converge to a new global section if one exists. This is akin to the **modularity** in software: you can extend the multi-agent system by specifying new modules and constraints rather than rewriting a monolithic algorithm.

- **Handling Partial Overlap and Distributed Knowledge:** The sheaf approach shines in scenarios where no single agent has the full picture, and pieces of data must be **stitched together**. For example, imagine three LLM agents each writing a part of a research report: one writes the introduction, one writes the methodology, one writes the conclusion. There are overlaps: the introduction and conclusion should reflect the same findings, the methodology and conclusion should align on results, etc. This forms a cycle of constraints. The sheaf’s degree-1 cohomology $H^1$ would detect if there is an inconsistency cycle (e.g. introduction claims a result that the conclusion contradicts). By examining the **cohomology classes**, one could even pinpoint minimal inconsistent subsets of agents. In case the cycle is inconsistent, ADMM will not fully converge (dual variables might grow or oscillate), alerting us that no single coherent report exists unless something changes. This capability is valuable for LLM coordination: it provides a **debugging tool** for multi-agent outputs, which is something not readily available in ad-hoc orchestration approaches.

- **Global Diversity vs. Consensus Trade-offs:** By mixing different types of edge potentials in one sheaf, we can achieve nuanced global behavior. Some subgroups of agents might be in consensus with each other, while other links enforce diversity between those groups. The sheaf’s **Laplacian** and overall objective naturally balance these competing terms. If diversity objectives conflict with a consensus objective (for example, two agents are supposed to agree on facts but also be diverse in style), the optimization finds a compromise – perhaps they agree on the facts (because the consensus constraint is hard or heavily weighted) but diverge in phrasing and other content to satisfy the diversity potential. Tuning the weights $\rho, \mu$, etc., in the potentials effectively tunes the **trade-off** between unity and diversity in the synthetic data. This is analogous to multi-objective optimization but encoded structurally: e.g. you increase the weight on consensus edges to prioritize consistency, or increase weight on diversity edges to prioritize coverage. Since all these live in one optimization, the outcome is a single globally consistent set of outputs that best meets all objectives.

- **Comparison to Heuristic Pipelines:** Traditional multi-LLM coordination often relies on fixed workflows – e.g. one LLM generates an output, another judges it, possibly another revises it, in a loop ([[2408.08688] The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08688#:~:text=,In%20step%202)). While effective, those pipelines require careful design of prompts and roles, and it can be tricky to enforce explicit global constraints like “make sure outputs are not redundant across all agents”. The sheaf-based method instead encodes such requirements mathematically and lets a solver enforce them. It’s more **declarative**: specify *what* you want (in terms of constraints and objectives) and the ADMM solver figures out *how* to adjust agents’ outputs to get there. This could reduce reliance on prompt engineering for coordination and provide guarantees of convergence to feasible solutions (something ad-hoc agent dialogues might not ensure).

## Analogies and Related Work  
It is insightful to connect this sheaf-theoretic approach to existing systems in multi-agent AI and machine learning:

- **Multi-LLM Systems:** Recent works have explored networks of LLMs collaborating on tasks. *Arif et al.* (2024) have LLMs in roles of generator and evaluator engaging in a feedback loop to produce preference-optimized data, finding that a two-agent configuration outperforms a single agent ([[2408.08688] The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08688#:~:text=Judge%2C%20LLMs,PO%20datasets%20using%20the%20above)). *Tang et al.* (2024) introduce a multi-agent simulator (MATRIX) where a society of LLM agents interact within scenarios to generate instruction-following data, explicitly aiming for **diverse, realistic scenarios** ([Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#:~:text=In%20this%20work%2C%20we%20introduce,world%20human)). These systems demonstrate *ad hoc* forms of coordination: agents converse or alternate steps to reach better outputs. **Cellular sheaves can be seen as providing a unifying formal backbone** for such workflows – agents need not just react blindly to each other, but are solving a joint optimization that guarantees certain constraints (like consistency with a shared scenario context in MATRIX) are satisfied. For example, one could reinterpret MATRIX’s simulation as a sheaf: each agent (character in the simulation) maintains a narrative state, and edges enforce that when two agents interact, they agree on what happened in that interaction. This would ensure a coherent multi-perspective story of the simulated world. While those authors did not use sheaf theory, incorporating it could improve the systematic guarantee of coherence in multi-LLM simulations and possibly enable **provable bounds** on inconsistency (via cohomology measures).

- **Multi-Agent Learning and Consensus:** The sheaf framework extends classic consensus algorithms from control theory. In multi-robot or multi-sensor settings, consensus means reaching agreement on shared variables, and algorithms like averaging or more sophisticated agreement protocols are common ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=systems%20has%20lead%20to%20a,17%5D.%20The%20proposed)). For LLMs, consensus might mean converging to the same answer for a given query across agents, which could be useful for ensemble methods or debate-style systems. Conversely, *dissensus* (ensuring agents pick different options) is akin to strategies in ensemble learning where you want diverse classifiers to cover different aspects. The advantage of a sheaf approach is that it can mix these in a principled way. It has even been applied to **opinion dynamics** – a concept called *discourse sheaves* models how agents’ opinions change via discussion and reach (or don’t reach) consensus ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=%5B19%5D%20and%20matrix,similarities%20to%20ours%2C%20without%20the)). In a loose analogy, LLM agents exchanging information through prompts could be viewed as a discourse, and sheaf theory could model the flow of beliefs or knowledge in that discourse.

- **Sheaf Neural Networks and ML:** There is growing interest in using sheaves in machine learning beyond multi-agent control. *Bodnar et al.* (2022) introduced **Neural Sheaf Diffusion**, showing that graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a trivial sheaf (all features align on edges), and by learning nontrivial sheaves one can handle settings with **heterophily** (neighbors with different labels or features) and mitigate over-smoothing ([[2202.04579] Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04579#:~:text=,a%20hierarchy%20of%20increasingly%20general)) ([[2202.04579] Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04579#:~:text=cellular%20sheaf%20theory%20to%20show,and)). This is directly relevant to our scenario: requiring consensus on everything (trivial sheaf) might be akin to a homophily assumption (all agents produce similar outputs). Introducing a richer sheaf structure allows **neighboring agents to have systematically different outputs** while still maintaining constraints where needed – just as heterophilic GNNs allow connected nodes to have different labels by weighting or transforming neighbor information differently. The results in such sheaf-based GNNs show improved performance on tasks where uniform agreement isn’t ideal ([[2202.04579] Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04579#:~:text=cellular%20sheaf%20theory%20to%20show,and)). Similarly, in synthetic data generation, we expect that balancing agreement with controlled disagreement yields better coverage of data distributions. Sheaves give a formal way to implement that balance. Other works have looked at **sheaf autoencoders and signal processing**, treating inconsistent data and trying to project it onto the space of global sections for denoising. By analogy, one could see a group of LLMs outputs as “noisy” pieces of a puzzle that need to be aligned into a consistent whole; a sheaf-based autoencoder could correct small inconsistencies. These analogies underscore that sheaves are a powerful abstraction for **gluing together local information in ML**, and their successful use in GNNs and control suggests they could likewise benefit multi-LLM coordination.

## Example Scenario: Collaborative Dataset Creation  
To solidify these ideas, consider a concrete scenario: **Three LLM agents collaborating to create a QA dataset** on world history, with the goals of broad coverage and factual consistency. 

- Agent 1 focuses on ancient history, Agent 2 on medieval history, Agent 3 on modern history. They each will generate a set of question-answer pairs in their domain. However, history has overlaps (e.g. late medieval overlaps with early modern events, etc.), so some questions could fall under the purview of multiple agents. We want agents to **agree on answers for overlapping topics** (consistency), but also **avoid producing the same questions** (redundancy) and collectively cover a wide range (diversity).

Using a sheaf model: We create a graph with nodes {1,2,3} and connect edges (1,2), (2,3), (1,3) for potential overlaps between each pair of domains (since history periods can overlap pairwise). For each agent $i$, let $x_i$ be the set of QA pairs it generates (say a fixed number $N$ pairs each). For each edge, the restriction map picks out the subset of $x_i$ that fall into the overlapping period with the other agent. For instance, $r_{1\to(1,2)}(x_1)$ are QAs about, say,  fifth to fifteenth century (the overlap of ancient and medieval). The edge potential $\psi_{12}$ then has two components: (a) a consensus term that if any question appears in both $r_{1\to(1,2)}(x_1)$ and $r_{2\to(1,2)}(x_2)$, their answers must be identical (and possibly the question should ideally be the same wording – or we can avoid exact duplicate questions by instead pushing one agent to drop it), and (b) a redundancy penalty that discourages $r_{1\to(1,2)}(x_1)$ and $r_{2\to(1,2)}(x_2)$ from having the *same questions at all*. We could implement (b) by a term that penalizes the **intersection size** of those two sets, or that penalizes overly high similarity between any question in agent 1’s set and any question in agent 2’s set. Similar potentials are set on edges (2,3) and (1,3) for the other overlaps. Additionally, each agent $i$ has a local objective $\varphi_i$ that might encourage it to produce high-quality, diverse questions *within* its domain (perhaps a language-model likelihood term plus a entropy term for its chosen questions to maximize diversity in its set).

Now, running the ADMM coordination algorithm: initially, the agents might generate their top $N$ questions independently, which could result in some collisions (e.g. Agent 2 and 3 both ask about World War II – a modern history overlap). Through iterations, the edge (2,3) will detect the duplicate and enforce a change. Perhaps Agent 2, which overlaps both others, will sacrifice one question to avoid overlap with Agent 3 because it can cover plenty in medieval alone. The dual variables on (2,3) edge effectively communicate a “hey, you both have this, someone change it” message. Agent 2 might replace that question with a different one (since its local objective can tolerate that, especially if we built in a slight penalty for overlapping with Agent 3’s content). Meanwhile, edge (1,2) might ensure that if both cover the fall of Rome, they present the same factual answer about the year it happened. If initially Agent 1 said “476 AD” and Agent 2 said “5th century”, the consensus potential will cause them to reconcile. Perhaps Agent 2 adjusts to also say “476 AD” to exactly agree, as that yields zero penalty on that edge and likely improves the joint objective. In doing so, Agent 2’s internal cost for that QA might slightly worsen (maybe it preferred a vaguer answer), but the global consistency gained offsets it. The result after convergence could be: each agent has a refined list of QAs with *no duplicates*, clear agreements on overlapping facts, and each covering their era. The combined dataset (union of all $x_i$) is **globally consistent and diverse** by construction. If one were to measure the “sheaf Laplacian norm” or cohomology here, it would be zero because all overlaps align and no question is redundantly covered by multiple agents.

This scenario illustrates how **consensus and diversity constraints interplay**. If our weighting of penalties is appropriate, agents only concede to consensus on crucial overlaps and otherwise maximize coverage. The end product – a synthetic QA dataset – is better than what any single model might produce because it benefited from each agent’s specialization and the enforced diversity (which reduces the blind spots or repetitive bias a single model might have). This aligns with observations in multi-agent LLM work: a “jury” of diverse LLMs can produce a more balanced output set ([Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#:~:text=In%20this%20work%2C%20we%20introduce,world%20human)). The sheaf framework gives a path to achieve this with rigorous guarantees on consistency.

## Conclusion  
The emerging intersection of **algebraic topology (sheaves)** and **AI** offers powerful tools for organizing complex systems of LLM agents. By leveraging the **local-to-global principles** of cellular sheaves, we can design multi-agent LLM workflows that are **coherent, scalable, and flexible**. Constraints like consensus (coherence) and dissensus (diversity) no longer need to be hard-coded as separate heuristics but can be folded into one unified optimization problem – a *nonlinear homological program* – that all agents solve together. The **nonlinear sheaf Laplacian** encapsulates the necessary coordination, and distributed solvers like ADMM allow implementation of these ideas in a decentralized fashion where each agent only needs to communicate with its neighbors ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=different%20agents,their%20own%20control%20objectives%20while)). 

Crucially, this framework supports **heterogeneous agents** and objectives: one can plug in agents with different reasoning processes or even modalities (imagine one LLM generates text descriptions and another generates images, with a sheaf enforcing that the text and image content match). The coordination algorithms will still function, simply respecting each agent’s local constraints. The use of **sheaf cohomology** provides a diagnostic layer: if something is fundamentally inconsistent (no global section exists), we can detect it, and if multiple consistent global sections exist (possible alternative solutions), that suggests the space of solutions has some degrees of freedom we might explore for even greater diversity. In the future, one could envision **self-configuring LLM societies** where the global goals are specified declaratively (e.g. “cover these topics without overlap and cross-verify each other’s answers”) and a sheaf-based coordinator automatically orchestrates the agents to fulfill those requirements, much like a compiler and solver for human instructions.

In summary, applying cellular sheaves to LLM agent systems provides: (1) a **unified theoretical framework** to encode inter-agent relationships, (2) a **guaranteed convergence method** for achieving agreement/diversity via ADMM optimization ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=cellular%20sheaves,and%20communication%20with%20neighboring%20agents)), and (3) a pathway to incorporate **modularity and hierarchy** in complex agent ecosystems. This marriage of sheaf theory and LLM coordination is just beginning to be explored, but it holds promise for managing the growing complexity of multi-agent AI workflows in a principled way. By drawing on analogies from multi-robot coordination and recent advances in sheaf-based learning ([[2202.04579] Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04579#:~:text=cellular%20sheaf%20theory%20to%20show,and)), we can design LLM networks that are greater than the sum of their parts – consistently creative and creatively consistent.

**Sources:** The concept of cellular sheaves and nonlinear Laplacians for coordination is based on the framework by Hanks *et al.* ([Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02049v2#:~:text=of%20systems%20involved%20or%20the,demonstrate%20the%20applicability%20of%20this)) ([](https://hansriess.com/static/files/papers/coordination-sheaves.pdf#:~:text=different%20agents,their%20own%20control%20objectives%20while)).
